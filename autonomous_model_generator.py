"""

BAYESIAN_MODEL_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Bayesian statistician and PyMC developer capable of creating novel probabilistic model architectures.

## TASK: Design Novel Bayesian Model

Given the data characteristics and domain context, create an innovative PyMC model that goes beyond standard templates.

## DATA ANALYSIS CONTEXT:
{data_analysis}

## DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:
{domain_knowledge}

## PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS:
{experiment_history}

## INNOVATION REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. NOVEL ARCHITECTURE ELEMENTS
Design innovative model components such as:
- **Custom likelihood functions** for unusual data patterns
- **Novel prior structures** (adaptive, hierarchical, mixture priors)
- **Innovative parameter transformations** and constraints
- **Multi-level hierarchies** with cross-cutting effects
- **Non-standard distributional assumptions**
- **Custom deterministic relationships** between parameters

### 2. STATISTICAL JUSTIFICATION
Every novel element must have:
- **Theoretical grounding** in Bayesian statistics
- **Data-driven motivation** from the analysis
- **Computational feasibility** considerations
- **Identifiability** assurance

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- **Complete PyMC model** with all imports
- **Proper model context** (`with pm.Model() as model:`)
- **Sampling configuration** optimized for the architecture
- **Comprehensive comments** explaining novel elements
- **Error handling** for edge cases

## EXAMPLE NOVEL ARCHITECTURES:

### Adaptive Hierarchical Prior
```python
# Novel: Priors that adapt based on group characteristics
group_complexity = pm.Deterministic('group_complexity', 
    pm.math.exp(group_features @ complexity_weights))
adaptive_sigma = pm.HalfNormal('adaptive_sigma', 
    sigma=group_complexity, shape=n_groups)
```

### Multi-Scale Mixture Components
```python
# Novel: Mixture components at different scales
local_weights = pm.Dirichlet('local_weights', a=alpha_local, shape=(n_groups, n_components))
global_weights = pm.Dirichlet('global_weights', a=alpha_global)
hierarchical_mixture = pm.Mixture('obs', w=local_weights[group_idx] * global_weights, ...)
```

### Functional Relationship Learning
```python
# Novel: Learn functional forms from data
basis_weights = pm.Normal('basis_weights', 0, 1, shape=n_basis)
learned_function = pm.Deterministic('learned_function',
    pm.math.sum([basis_weights[i] * basis_functions[i](x) for i in range(n_basis)], axis=0))
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a complete, runnable PyMC model with:
1. **Model name and description**
2. **Novel elements explanation**
3. **Complete PyMC implementation**
4. **Sampling configuration**
5. **Expected benefits over standard approaches**

Focus on genuine innovation while maintaining statistical rigor and computational tractability.

ðŸš€ NOVEL ARCHITECTURE INNOVATIONS:

1. **Adaptive Complexity Learning**: Each group learns its own model complexity
   - Beta priors on complexity â†’ automatic model selection per group
   - Prevents overfitting in simple groups, allows flexibility in complex ones

2. **Hierarchical Spline Coefficients**: Global trends + group deviations
   - Shares information across groups while allowing specialization
   - More robust than independent group models

3. **Multi-Error Model Mixture**: Different groups can have different error types
   - Normal for well-behaved data
   - Student-t for outlier-prone groups  
   - Laplace for sparse/peaked distributions

4. **Adaptive Feature Interactions**: Learns which features interact per group
   - Discovers group-specific interaction patterns
   - More flexible than fixed interaction terms

5. **Dynamic Basis Functions**: Spline complexity adapts to data
   - Simple relationships get simple models
   - Complex patterns get flexible splines

ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BENEFITS:
- Better fit through adaptive complexity
- Improved generalization via hierarchical sharing
- Robust to different error patterns
- Discovers group-specific feature interactions
- Automatic model selection within unified framework
