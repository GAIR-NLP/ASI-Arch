        "DESIGN_INSIGHT": "### Hierarchical Bayesian Models for Grouped Data with Partial Pooling",
        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Statistical_Performance_Signatures**:\n- Improved parameter estimation when data exhibits natural grouping structures (schools, regions, patients, subjects)\n- Better generalization to new groups through partial pooling that borrows strength across groups\n- Reduced overfitting compared to separate group models, especially with small group sizes\n- More stable predictions with appropriate uncertainty quantification across group hierarchy\n- Effective handling of unbalanced group sizes through information sharing\n- Superior performance on out-of-sample group prediction tasks\n**Diagnostic_Indicators**:\n- Convergence diagnostics show stable MCMC sampling (R-hat < 1.01, ESS > 400)\n- Shrinkage parameters indicate appropriate pooling levels (not too extreme)\n- Posterior predictive checks validate model assumptions within and across groups\n- Group-level parameter estimates show reasonable shrinkage toward population mean\n- Hierarchical variance components are well-identified and interpretable",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Context**: Hierarchical modeling addresses fundamental statistical challenges in grouped data analysis where observations within groups are more similar than observations between groups. Traditional approaches either ignore grouping structure (complete pooling) or treat groups as completely independent (no pooling), both leading to suboptimal inference.\n**Historical_Development**: Developed from empirical Bayes methods in the 1970s, formalized in fully Bayesian framework by Gelman & others in 1990s. Now standard for multilevel data in psychology, education, ecology, and medicine.\n**Key_Insight**: Partial pooling automatically balances individual group characteristics with population-level patterns, providing optimal bias-variance tradeoff.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Statistical_Method**:\n- Model group-specific parameters as random draws from common population distributions\n- Hyperpriors on population parameters enable automatic learning of appropriate pooling strength\n- Hierarchical structure naturally handles varying group sizes and missing data patterns\n**Mathematical_Framework**:\n- Group-specific intercepts: αⱼ ~ Normal(μ_α, σ_α) for j = 1,...,J groups\n- Population hyperparameters: μ_α ~ Normal(0, 10), σ_α ~ HalfNormal(5)\n- Data likelihood: yᵢⱼ ~ Normal(αⱼ + βxᵢⱼ, σ) for observations i in group j\n- Can extend to hierarchical slopes: βⱼ ~ Normal(μ_β, σ_β)\n**Computational_Properties**:\n- MCMC sampling efficiency depends on centered vs non-centered parameterizations\n- Non-centered parameterization: αⱼ = μ_α + σ_α * ξⱼ where ξⱼ ~ Normal(0,1)\n- Scales well with number of groups and observations per group",

Monitor divergences to guide choice.\n**Application_Conditions**: Most effective with 5+ groups, ideally 3+ observations per group. Works with unbalanced designs and missing data.",
        "DESIGN_AI_INSTRUCTIONS": "**Agent_Guidance_For_Autonomous_Application**:\n- **Detection_Triggers**: Recommend hierarchical models when EDA reveals categorical grouping variables with meaningful within-group correlation\n- **Data_Requirements**: Verify sufficient groups (≥5) and reasonable group sizes (≥3 observations preferred)\n- **Model_Selection**: Start with hierarchical intercepts; add hierarchical slopes if group-specific relationships vary\n- **Parameterization_Strategy**: Begin with non-centered parameterization; switch to centered if poor mixing observed\n- **Convergence_Monitoring**: Pay special attention to variance components (σ_α, σ_β) which can be challenging to sample\n- **Validation_Approach**: Use posterior predictive checks within groups and cross-validation at group level\n- **Innovation_Opportunities**: Consider time-varying hierarchical parameters, non-linear group-level relationships, or mixture components within hierarchy"

        "EXPERIMENTAL_TRIGGER_PATTERNS": "**Statistical_Performance_Signatures**:\n- Automatic adaptation to optimal shrinkage levels without manual tuning\n- Robust performance across datasets with varying between-group heterogeneity\n- Improved parameter estimation when group effects range from homogeneous to highly heterogeneous\n- Better handling of extreme groups without over-shrinkage or under-shrinkage\n- Enhanced predictive performance on new groups through learned shrinkage patterns\n**Diagnostic_Indicators**:\n- Hierarchical variance parameters (σ_α) show good posterior identification\n- Shrinkage diagnostics indicate appropriate pooling strength for data structure\n- Effective sample sizes remain high for hierarchical variance components\n- Posterior predictive checks validate shrinkage decisions across group heterogeneity spectrum",
        "BACKGROUND": "**Context**: Traditional hierarchical models require specification of hyperprior distributions that control shrinkage strength. Poor choices lead to over-shrinkage (excessive pooling) or under-shrinkage (insufficient borrowing of strength).\n**Technical_Challenge**: Fixed hyperpriors may not match the true between-group variation structure in the data, leading to biased group-specific estimates.\n**Solution_Approach**: Adaptive hyperpriors that learn appropriate shrinkage from data while maintaining computational tractability.",
        "ALGORITHMIC_INNOVATION": "**Core_Method**:\n- Replace fixed hyperpriors with adaptive hierarchical structures that learn shrinkage from data\n- Use heavy-tailed priors (e.g., half-Cauchy) for variance components to allow wide range of shrinkage levels\n- Implement regularized horseshoe priors for sparse group effects when many groups may be similar\n**Mathematical_Framework**:\n- Half-Cauchy hyperprior: σ_α ~ HalfCauchy(0, scale) with data-adaptive scale\n- Alternative: σ_α ~ HalfNormal(0, σ_hyperprior) where σ_hyperprior ~ HalfCauchy(0, 1)\n- For sparse settings: αⱼ ~ Normal(0, τ²λⱼ²) with λⱼ ~ HalfCauchy(0,1), τ ~ HalfCauchy(0,1)\n**Computational_Advantage**: Heavy-tailed priors provide better MCMC mixing for variance components while enabling flexible shrinkage adaptation.",

        "DESIGN_AI_INSTRUCTIONS": "**Agent_Guidance**: Use adaptive hyperpriors when group heterogeneity is unknown. Monitor σ_α posterior to understand learned shrinkage level. If σ_α posterior is concentrated near zero, groups are similar; if spread wide, groups are heterogeneous. Recommend this approach as default for hierarchical models unless strong prior knowledge exists about group variation."
